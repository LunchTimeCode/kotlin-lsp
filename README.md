# kotlin-lsp
Maybe I get somewhere...

I got my starting sources from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/uu47mk/how_to_make_a_lsp_in_rust/)

## Things I plan to use:

- https://github.com/ebkalderon/tower-lsp
- https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter -> maybe starting building on top of https://github.com/fwcd/tree-sitter-kotlin
- Incremental document updates I will need to tackle alone
